# ArkaPong (pre-alpha)

ArkaPong is a hybrid game combining the classic "Arkanoid" (from NES) with "Pong". This game is being developed from scratch in C++ using SDL2 libraries. It is currently in pre-alpha stage and requires structural improvements. It should be compatible with Windows and any Linux distribution.

## Features (planned)
- Classic Arkanoid and Pong gameplay elements
- Single-player and multiplayer
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Multiple levels and game modes

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (not required for Windows)
- Libraries:
  - [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) (2.30.x)
  - [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) (2.8.x)
  - [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) (2.22.x)
- A compiler for C++ 17.
  - Windows: MSVC v143-VS 2022
  - Linux: GCC, Clang or any compatible with ``CMakeLists.txt``.
- On Windows you can use VCPKG to download SDL2 packages.

### How set VCPKG_ROOT?
- Windows:
  You can set the VCPKG_ROOT variable as follows:
  Open “Control Panel” → “System” → “Advanced System Settings”.
  Under “Environment Variables”, create a new environment variable with the name VCPKGG_ROOT and the value of the vcpkg installation path (for example, C:/vcpkg).

- Linux:
  ``` sh
  export VCPKG_ROOT=$HOME/vcpkg
  ```
  You can add this to the .bashrc or .zshrc file so that it is applied every time you open a terminal.

### Build
1. Download source code or clone the repository with Git
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IgnacioVeiga/ArkaPong.git
   cd ArkaPong
   ```
2. - Linux: Use CMake (check the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files) and run:
   ``` sh
   cmake -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```
    - Windows: (TODO: UPDATE THIS) Use Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 to build and run (using CMake in this case may give you an error when searching for SDL2 libraries, use VCPKG instead.).

3. Finally check the build folder, the executable should be accompanied by the “assets” folder in order to run.

## Additional Notes
If you use Visual Studio Code, you can configure CMake Tools to handle presets and simplify the configuration and compilation process.

## Cleaning the project
To remove all files generated by CMake build, simply delete the build directory. Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 already has a clean function.

I'm very new to C/C++, so any contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
