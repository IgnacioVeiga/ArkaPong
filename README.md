# ArkaPong (pre-alpha)

ArkaPong is a hybrid game combining the classic "Arkanoid" (from NES) with "Pong". This game is being developed from scratch in C++ using SDL2 libraries.

## Features (planned)
- Classic Arkanoid and Pong gameplay elements
- Single-player and multiplayer modes
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Multiple levels and game modes
