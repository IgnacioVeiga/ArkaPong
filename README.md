# ArkaPong (pre-alpha)

ArkaPong is a hybrid game combining the classic "Arkanoid" (from NES) with "Pong". This game is being developed from scratch in C++ using SDL2 libraries. It is currently in pre-alpha stage and requires structural improvements. It should be compatible with Windows and any Linux distribution.

## Features (planned)
- Classic Arkanoid and Pong gameplay elements
- Single-player and multiplayer
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Multiple levels and game modes
- A frontend/GUI only for the Game Engine

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (not required for Windows)
- Libraries (Each one should be downloaded automatically, check the <a href="CMakeLists.txt">CMakeLists.txt</a> file):
  - [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) (2.32.0)
  - [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) (2.8.1)
  - [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) (2.24.0)
- A compiler for C++ 17 (Tested with MSVC v143-VS 2022 and Clang).

### Build
1. Download source code or clone the repository with Git
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IgnacioVeiga/ArkaPong.git
   cd ArkaPong
   ```

2. Run in the terminal:
   ``` sh
   cmake -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```

3. Finally check the directory ``build\bin\*``, the game executable should be accompanied by the “assets” folder in order to run.

## Additional Notes
If you use Visual Studio Code, you can configure CMake Tools to handle presets and simplify the configuration and compilation process.

## Cleaning the project
To remove all files generated by CMake build, simply delete the ``build`` folder.
